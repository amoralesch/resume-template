# Resume Template

This is a skeleton of the current template that I use for my resume.

It is written in LaTex and uses the following packages:

* [CurVe](https://ctan.org/pkg/curve);
* _TBU_.

## Make it your own

This repo includes a sample resume, if you want to make it your own,
you need to update the files inside the `rubric` directory. Also have a
look at the `header.tex` and `resume.tex` files.

You can also customize some options (i.e. colors, icons, etc). For this,
check the file `settings.sty`.
